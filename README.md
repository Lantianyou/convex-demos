# Convex Demos

## Welcome to Convex

Convex is a platform for building fast, scalable, dynamic applications without
the complexity of managing a backend or interacting with a database. Convex
_understands_ the relationship between your code and your data. Dynamic updates
to UI components in response to changes in server state are as simple as binding
them to functions and letting Convex take care of the rest.

This repo contains demo apps to get you started with the Convex platform.

### Build dependencies via:

```bash
cd 0-hello-convex
npm install
```
